- and more !

# Installation:
#### Releases
All releases that are published are ready to run out of the box, simply add the DiscordBot_vX_Y_Z.phar to your plugins directory.

*Note you must start the server with the plugin before you can edit the config files.*

**DEPRECATION NOTICE**
- This project has been deprecated and discontinued.
- This is because I am currently not enjoying making an API specifically for Pocketmine.
- I may be releasing per discord bot open source in the future. I am still using PMMP, but most of its events are now inside the Discord API, not through Pocketmine's events.
- This is so I can provide more support for things like `Interactions`, `Slash Commands`, and more. I haven't even begun to decide what I want to do with this project yet. But for the time being, it's staying private (The brand new one I'm working on), and this project has been archived. I am sorry it has come to this, but simply I don't enjoy it anymore. I have a discord server for Minecraft and discord which you can join if you want. The link is here: https://discord.horizonhub.live
- Thank you for understanding!
